- devDirs now saves relative paths too.

Version 4.9.9.6 - 20 Juli 2011

- Fixed the language option in the executable information tab. It didn't properly set the listbox to the saved setting (losing settings upon next save).
- Fixed a bug in the file association code: icons were missing.
- Lines like 'in member function', 'in constructor' and 'in destructor' are now properly formatted in the Compiler Tab (no line and col numbers anymore).
- Added line and column formatting for 'In static member function'.
- Fixed the file version string: it now keeps in sync with incremented build numbers.
- The spin edits which control the Project file version are now kept in sync with the strings below.
- Added an option to synchronize product and file versions.
- Set the default installation directory to (Program Files)\Dev-C++ instead of C:\Dev-Cpp.

Version 4.9.9.5 - 16 Juli 2011

- Added column reporting for a few more error types.
- Made a proper portable version this time: it comes in a 7zip file, saving a few more registry entries compared to 4.9.9.4's portable setup.
- Dev-C++ now adds itself to Windows' "Programs and Features" list.

Version 4.9.9.4 - 12 Juli 2011

- Added a %path% macro to every path. Use this string in the config files to add relative paths to Compiler Directories.
- Fixed a bug in the Code Completion Cache Creator (CCCC :D): it used to add two copies of every file (one relatively referred to and one referred to with a full path).
- Cleaned up a few duplicate and unused headers and binaries. The installer is now a whopping 200KiB smaller.
- Updated the make.exe searcher to check for GCC 4.5.2's make.exe.
- Added a few NSIS installation profiles: minimalist and portable.
- Fixed a few grammar errors.
- Updated the About window layout and text.
- Added an icon to the NSIS installer.

Version 4.9.9.3 - 24 Juni 2011

- Upgraded the default compiler to GCC 4.5.2.
- When encountering an error, Dev-C++ will now position the caret next to it.
- Added some more -march optimization options, including core2, k8-sse3, amdfam10, 'native' and 'generic'.
- Cleaned up the explicit -m(instruction set) options by removing outdated and unsupported ones. Added a couple of modern instructions
- Cleaned up the TODO viewer layout.
- Fixed a bug in the compiler error parser: it used to read 1 byte too much afer the \0 of each error line, possibly causing crashes.
- Added a 'Column' column in the Compiler log.
- Tweaked the default settings, by enabling line numbers by default for example.
- Fixed a bug in the compiler set creator: it wasn't storing storing command line options for each compiler.
- Added more UI controls for frequently used GCC flags like -Wall, -Wextra and -pedantic.
- Moved warning related flag options to a new section called 'Code Warnings'.
- Removed the compiler optimization tree controls. Now has a proper None/Low/Med/High combobox.
- Updated the default directory listings to GCC 4.5.2's directories.
- Removed the [Compiler] section from the ini file. Instead of saving the current Compiler Set twice, it saves a Compiler index to refer to.
- And some more stuff I forgot about.

* New option in Editor Options: Show editor hints. User can disable the hints
  displayed in the editor when the mouse moves over a word. Since this was the
  cause of many errors (although it should be fixed by now), we are giving the
  user the option to disable this feature.
* New option in Editor Options (code-completion): Use code-completion cache.
  Well, it adds caching to code-completion. Depending on the cache size,
  the program may take a bit longer to start-up, but provides very fast
  code-completion and the user has all the commands (belonging to the files
  he added in the cache) at his fingertips. If, for example, the user adds
  "windows.h", he gets all the WinAPI! If he adds "wx/wx.h", he gets all of
  wxWindows! You get the picture...
* Removed "Only show classes from current file" option in class browser settings.
  It used to be a checkbox, allowing only two states (on or off), but there is
  a third relevant option now: "Project classes" so it didn't fit the purpose...
  The user can define this in the class browser's context menu under "View mode".
* Fixed the dreaded "Clock skew detected" compiler warning!
* Fixed many class browser bugs, including some that had to do with class folders.

  then we even get a stack trace in the bug report!
* Added new WebUpdate module (inactive temporarily).
* Added new code for code-completion caching of files (disabled - work in progress).

Version 4.9.5.2
* Added new option in class-browser: Use colors
  (available when right-clicking the class-browser
  and selecting "View mode").
* Dev-C++ now traps access violation of your programs (and of itself too ;)

Version 4.9.5.1
* Implemented the "File/Export/Project to HTML" function.
* Added "Tip of the day" system.
* When running a source file in explorer, don't spawn new instance.
  Instead open the file in an already launched Dev-C++.
* Class-parser speed-up (50% to 85% improvement timed!!!)
* Many code-completion updates. Now takes into account context,
  class inheritance and visibility (shows items only from files
  #included directly or indirectly)!
