1. Compiling devcpp.exe

The main executable devcpp.exe can be built using the following steps:
    1) patch the delphi 7 vcl (Delphi 7's Source/VCL/StdCtrls.pas) using:
       Source\VCL\patch\WinTheme.patch 
       compile the StdCtrls.pas and replace the StdCtrls.dcu in delphi's Lib folder with it
       (it fixes the problem that press alt will cause buttons in dialogs to disapear in windows with themes)

	1) Compile and install the following package(s):
		Source\VCL\SynEdit\Packages\SynEdit_<Delphi Version>.dpk (only delphi 7 works now)
		Source\VCL\ClassBrowsing\ClassBrowsing.dpk
		Source\VCL\DevCpp\DevCpp.dpk
        Source\VCL\Containers\Containers.dpk (not used now)
        Source\VCL\VirtualTreeView

	2) Compile resources by running the following script(s):
		Source\CompileResources.bat
		
	3) Open the project file devcpp.dpr. Your IDE should not produce any 
	   'Module Not Found' or 'Resource Not Found' errors when opening files, 
	   compiling files or running devcpp.exe.

	4) It is advisable to run CleanSource.bat before commiting work, when you
	   get errors complaining about old versions of code or when you want to 
	   diff the source folder.

This process has only been tested using Delphi 6 and Delphi 7. The code base
should be compatible with more recent versions of Delphi, but there is no 
guarantee anything will work.

2. Compiling associated tools

There are a couple of executables that need to be compiled and/or put in the
right folder when building a release. These files can be found in the 
Source\Tools subfolder. Precompiled files are available in the Tools folder in
the SourceForge repository. All three associated are required to be present by
the setup scripts.

	1) ConsolePauser.exe. This needs to be put in the root directory next to
	   devcpp.exe. This executable is launched by devcpp.exe when a console 
	   program is run and the option "Pause console programs after return" is
	   enabled in Environment Options. This file can be compiled using
	   Source\Tools\ConsolePauser\ConsolePauser.dev
	   
	2) Packman.exe. This file is launched by the menu item located at
	   Tools >> Package Manager and provides .pak plugin support. 
	   
3. Other tools

Other tools provided for legacy reasons or to easy the developer's life are:

	1) GitPush. Automated script that adds, commits, and pushes the current code
	   base to the SourceForge git repo. Please position this executable in the
	   root folder of Dev-C++.
   
	2) LangCheck. Compares any language file to the english language file and
	   checks for missing entries and formatting options compatibility.
	   
	3) PackMaker. Used to create PAK extension files.
	   
4. Shortcut Map

This is an up to date map of the default shortcuts of Dev-C++. All Ctrl+(Letter)
combinations are in use, except for the following letters: UJKL. The Shift 
modifier should be added to a shortcut to signify a multiplicated version
of the regular shortcut. The use of Ctrl+Alt+(Key) or Shift+(Key) should be
avoided.
